//! # Memory State of a process
//!
//! In the project 1, you implemented the file state management for a
//! process. An equally important state of a process is memory state.
//! This memory state involves managing virtual memory regions, tracking memory
//! allocations, and implementing memory deallocation when memory is no longer
//! needed. The operating system must track all active mappings per process,
//! enforce correct access permissions, and ensure proper cleanup when memory is
//! unmapped.
//!
//! ## Memory in KeOS
//!
//! The state of a process's memory is represented by the [`MmStruct`]
//! structure, similiar to the Linux kernel's `struct mm_struct`. Each process
//! maintains an [`MmStruct`] instance, which tracks the memory mapping state
//! for a process. This state plays a central role for serving a memory mapping
//! system calls: **mmap** and **munmap**.
//!
//! Memory mapping (`mmap`) allows processes to allocate, share, or access
//! memory in a flexible way. It is commonly used for:
//! - Allocating memory dynamically without relying on heap or stack growth.
//! - Mapping files into memory for fast access.
//! - Sharing memory between processes.
//!
//! The `mmap` system call establishes a mapping between a process's virtual
//! address space and either physical memory or a file. These memory mappings
//! are recorded within the **page table**, similar to how regular memory pages
//! are managed. However, unlike normal heap allocations, `mmap`-based
//! allocations allow more control over page protection, mapping policies, and
//! address alignment. When a process accesses an address within the mapped
//! region, a **page fault** occurs, triggering the operating system to allocate
//! and map the corresponding physical pages.
//!
//! The [`MmStruct`] contains the two key components:
//! - **Page Table**: Tracks mappings between virtual and physical addresses.
//! - **Pager**: Defines the policy for memory mapping. and unmapping.`
//!
//! ### Validating User Input
//!
//! One of the important aspects of managing memory safely is ensuring that
//! user input, such as memory addresses provided by system calls, is validated
//! correctly. **The kernel must never crash due to user input.**
//!
//! Many system calls, like `read` and `write`, rely on user-supplied memory
//! addresses—typically as buffer pointers. These addresses need to be carefully
//! validated before they can be used to ensure the integrity and stability of
//! the system.
//!
//! Without proper validation, several serious problems may arise:
//! - **Unauthorized access to kernel memory**: If the user is allowed to access
//!   kernel memory, this can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities,
//!   potentially giving the user more control than intended.
//! - **Dereferencing invalid pointers**: Accessing uninitialized or incorrectly
//!   mapped memory can result in segmentation faults or undefined behavior,
//!   leading to crashes or unexpected outcomes.
//! - **Memory corruption**: Improper handling of memory can result in
//!   corrupting the system's memory state, which can affect other processes,
//!   crash the kernel, or destabilize the entire system.
//!
//! [`MmStruct`] mitigate these risks with the [`MmStruct::access_ok`] method,
//! which ensures that the memory addresses provided by system calls are **valid
//! and safe** before being used. This validation mechanism will
//! prevent dangerous operations by checking if memory access is allowed, based
//! on the current process's memory layout and protection policies.
//!
//! By incorporating proper validation, [`MmStruct::access_ok`] ensures that
//! invalid memory accesses are handled **gracefully**, returning appropriate
//! errors rather than causing kernel panics or undefined behavior. This
//! validation mechanism plays a crucial role in maintaining system integrity
//! and protecting the kernel from potential vulnerabilities.

//! ### `Pager`
//!
//! The actual behavior of [`MmStruct`] lies in the [`Pager`] trait.
//! When a user program invokes those system calls, the [`MmStruct`] parses the
//! arguements from the [`SyscallAbi`] and forwarded them to an implementation
//! of the [`Pager`] traits, which provides the core interface for handling
//! memory mappings. Similarly, the core implementation to validate memory also
//! lies on the [`Pager::access_ok`].
//!
//! ## Implementation Requirements
//! You need to implement the followings:
//! - [`MmStruct::mmap`]
//! - [`MmStruct::munmap`]
//! - [`MmStruct::access_ok`]
//!
//! After implementing them, move on to the next [`section`] to implement
//! paging policy, called `EagerPager`.
//!
