//! # Journaling for Crash Consistency.
//!
//! File systems must ensure data consistency in the presence of crashes or
//! power failures.  When a system crash or power failure occurs, in-progress
//! file operations may leave the file system in an inconsistent state, where
//! metadata and data blocks are only partially updated. This can lead to file
//! corruption, orphaned blocks, or even complete data loss. Thus, modern file
//! systems must guard against these scenarios to ensure durability and
//! recoverability.
//!
//! To address this, modern file systems employ **journaling**. Journaling
//! provides crash-consistency by recording intended changes to a special log
//! (called the journal) before applying them to the main file system. In the
//! event of a crash, the journal can be replayed to recover to a consistent
//! state. This significantly reduces the risk of data corruption and allows
//! faster recovery after unclean shutdowns, without the need for full
//! file system checks.
//!
//! In this approach, all intended updates, such as block allocations, inode
//! changes, or directory modifications, are first written to a special log
//! called the **journal**. Only after the log is safely persisted to disk,
//! the actual file system structures updated. In the event of a crash, the
//! system can replay the journal to restore a consistent state. This method
//! provides a clear "intent before action" protocol, making recovery
//! predictable and bounded.
//!
//! ## Journaling in KeOS
//!
//! To explore the fundamentals of crash-consistent file systems, **KeOS
//! implements a minimal meta-data journaling mechanism** using the well-known
//! technique of **write-ahead logging**. This mechanism ensures that
//! updates to file system structures are made durable and recoverable.
//!
//! The journaling mechanism is anchored by a **journal superblock**, which
//! includes a `commited` flag. This flag indicates whether the journal area
//! currently holds valid, committed journal data that has not yet been
//! checkpointed.
//!
//! Journals in KeOS structured around four key stages: **Metadata updates**,
//! **commit**, **checkpoint**, and **recovery**.
//!
//! ### 1. Metadata Updates
//!
//! In KeOS, journaling is tightly integrated with the [`RunningTransaction`]
//! struct, which acts as the central abstraction for managing write-ahead
//! logging of file system changes. All journaled operations must be serialized
//! through this structure to ensure consistency.
//!
//! Internally, [`RunningTransaction`] is protected by a `SpinLock` on the
//! journal superblock, enforcing **global serialization** of journal writes.
//! This design guarantees that only one transaction may be in progress at any
//! given time, preventing concurrent updates to the same block, which could
//! otherwise result in a corrupted or inconsistent state.
//!
//! Crucially, KeOS uses Rustâ€™s strong type system to enforce this safety at
//! compile time: without access to an active [`RunningTransaction`], it is
//! **impossible** to write metadata blocks. All metadata modifications must be
//! submitted explicitly via the `submit()` method, which stages the changes for
//! journaling.
//!
//! If you forget to submit modified blocks through [`RunningTransaction`], the
//! kernel will **panic** with a clear error message, catching the issue early
//! and avoiding silent corruption. This design provides both safety and
//! transparency, making metadata updates robust and auditable.
//!
//!
//! ### 2. Commit Phase: [`RunningTransaction::commit`]
//!
//! In the commit phase, KeOS records all pending modifications to a dedicated
//! **journal area** before applying them to their actual on-disk locations:
//!
//! A transaction begins with a **`TxBegin` block**, which contains a list of
//! logical block addresses that describe where the updates will eventually be
//! written. This is followed by the **journal data blocks**, which contain the
//! actual contents to be written to the specified logical blocks. Once all data
//! blocks have been written, a **`TxEnd` block** is appended to mark the
//! successful conclusion of the transaction. This write-ahead logging
//! discipline guarantees that no update reaches the main file system until its
//! full intent is safely recorded in the journal.
//!
//! You can write journal blocks with [`JournalWriter`] struct. This structure
//! is marked with a type that represent the stages of commit phase, enforcing
//! you to write journal blocks in a correct order.
//!
//! ### 3. Checkpoint Phase: [`Journal::checkpoint`]
//!
//! After a transaction is fully committed, the system proceeds to
//! **checkpoint** the journal. During checkpointing, the journaled data blocks
//! are copied from the journal area to their final destinations in the main
//! file system (i.e., to the logical block addresses specified in the `TxBegin`
//! block).
//!
//! Once all modified blocks have been written to their final locations, the
//! system clears the journal by resetting the `commited` flag in the journal
//! superblock. This indicates that the journal is no longer recovered when
//! crash.
//!
//! In modern file systems, checkpointing is typically performed
//! **asynchronously** in the background to minimize the latency of system calls
//! like `write()` or `fsync()`. This allows the file system to acknowledge the
//! operation as complete once the journal is committed, without waiting for the
//! final on-disk update.
//!
//! However, for simplicity in this project, **checkpointing is done
//! synchronously**: the file system waits until all journaled updates are
//! copied to their target locations before clearing the journal. This
//! simplifies correctness, avoids the need for background threads or
//! deferred work mechanisms, and reduces work for maintaining consistent view
//! between disk and commited data.
//!
//!
//! ### 4. Recovery: [`Journal::recovery`]
//!
//! If a crash occurs before the checkpointing phase completes, KeOS
//! **recovers** the file system during the next boot. It begins by inspecting
//! the journal superblock to determine whether a committed transaction exists.
//!
//! If the `committed` flag is set and a valid `TxBegin`/`TxEnd` pair is
//! present, this indicates a completed transaction whose changes have not yet
//! been checkpointed. In this case, KeOS retries the **checkpointing**. If the
//! journal is not marked as committed, the system discards the journal
//! entirely. This rollback ensures consistency by ignoring partially written
//! or aborted transactions.
//!
//! This recovery approach is both **bounded** and **idempotent**: it scans only
//! the small, fixed-size journal area, avoiding costly full file system
//! traversal, and it can safely retry recovery without side effects if
//! interrupted again.
//!
//! ## Implementation Requirements
//! You need to implement the followings:
//!   - [`Journal::recovery`]
//!   - [`Journal::checkpoint`]
//!   - [`JournalWriter::<TxBegin>::write_tx_begin`]
//!   - [`JournalWriter::<Block>::write_blocks`]
//!   - [`JournalWriter::<TxEnd>::write_tx_end`]
//!
//! After implement the functionalities, move on to the last [`section`] of the
//! KeOS.
