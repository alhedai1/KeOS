Whether accesses are actually limited or translated is described by platform-specific means. If this feature bit is set to 0, then the device has same access to memory addresses supplied to it as the driver has. In particular, the device will always use physical addresses matching addresses used by the driver (typically meaning physical addresses used by the CPU) and not translated further, and can access any address supplied to it by the driver.

This implies that the driver needs to use memory barriers suitable for devices described by the platform; e.g. for the PCI transport in the case of hardware PCI devices.
