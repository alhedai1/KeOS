/// A trait for a thread scheduler.
///
/// The [`Scheduler`] trait defines the common functionality expected from a
/// thread scheduler. It provides an interface for managing threads, determining
/// which thread to run next, and handling periodic timer interrupts. A thread
/// scheduler is responsible for controlling the execution of threads in a
/// system. The scheduler determines when each thread is allowed to run, how to
/// handle context switching, and ensures fair allocation of CPU time among all
/// threads.
///
/// This trait can be implemented by different types of schedulers, such as
/// Round Robin, Priority-based, or Multi-level Queue schedulers. Each
/// implementation may have a unique strategy for selecting the next
/// thread to run and handling thread management.
pub trait Scheduler {
    /// Peek a next thread to run.
    ///
    /// This method checks the queue and returns the next thread to run. If no
    /// threads are available, it returns `None`.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns an `Option<Box<Thread>>` containing the next thread to run or
    /// `None` if no threads are available to execute.
